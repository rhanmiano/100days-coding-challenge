// Day 1 Use console.log to print a message.
//   To start off, who would not want to do a Hello World program first. But instead of the basic output "Hello World!", why not give yourself a message on starting this kind of project.

let message = "Hi! Good luck on this journey of yours. Hoping that it would really turn out" +
        "well and that you can consider yourself a better one after you do the 100th challenge";

console.log(message);
