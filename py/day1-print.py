 # Pushing myself to do this 100 Days Coding Challenge.
##

# Day 1 Use python's print to show message on the terminal
#   To start off, who would not want to do a Hello World program first. But instead of the basic output "Hello World!", why not give yourself a message on starting this kind of project.

message = """Hi! Good luck on this journey of yours. Hoping that it would really turn out
well and that you can consider yourself a better one after you do the 100th challenge."""

print(message);
