# 100 Days Coding Challenge
My inner programmer-self is pushing me to do a coding challenge to require myself to sit in front of the computer for a couple of hours a day and solve programming challenges available on the internet. I still consider myself as a beginner(a lazy one too) that's why I'm making this leap to enhance my coding skills. This challenge should render 100 solutions to 100 problems for 100 days. 
## Objectives

 1. Get a refresher of the fundamentals of the languages of web
 2. Push myself to think hard and code hard
 3. Get a hold of the difference between **"Learning by reading & watching"** and **"Learning by practice"**
 4. Practice proper documentation, apply coding standards

## Setup
- Skipping of day(s) is allowed. (Wait what?) Yes, the main goal here is not to code for 100 days consecutively.
- Challenges are handpicked from the internet which are listed in `challenges.md`
  - 20 kick-off challenges
  - 30 intermediate ones
  - 30 hard ones
  - 20 supposed to be harder challenges
- Solutions are written in three different languages namely:
  - Javascript (ES6)
  - PHP (5.6)
  - Python (3.7)
