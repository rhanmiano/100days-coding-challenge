# 100 Days Coding Challenge
My inner programmer-self is pushing me to do a coding challenge to require myself to sit in front of the computer for a couple of hours a day and solve programming challenges available on the internet. I still consider myself as a beginner(a lazy one too) that's why I'm making this leap to enhance my coding skills. This challenge should render 100 solutions to 100 problems for 100 days. 
## Objectives

 1. Get a refresher of the fundamentals of the languages of web
 2. Push myself to think hard and code hard
 3. Get a hold of the difference between **"Learning by reading or watching"** and **"Learning by practice"**
 4. Practice proper documentation, apply coding standards

## Setup
- Skipping of day(s) is allowed. (Wait what?) Yes, the main goal here is not to code for 100 days consecutively. Well, everybody needs some kind of rest day(s) in everything that they do right?
- Challenges are handpicked from the internet which are listed in `challenges.md`
  - 20 kick-off challenges
  - 30 intermediate ones
  - 30 hard ones
  - 20 supposed to be harder challenges
- Solutions are written in three different languages namely:
  - Javascript (ES6)
  - PHP (5.6)
  - Python (3.7)
